Dog by Shel Silverstein

Dog loves me,
Dog cares,
Dog picks me peaches and pears.
Dog offers me candy and Cokes,
Dog listens and laughs at me jokes.
Dog helps when I get in a fight,
Dog does all my homework at night.
Dog misses me,
Dog cries,
Dog thinks I'm a wonderful guy.
So if you ask me who's my best friend, in a whiz,
I'll stand up and tell you that Dog is.
But yesterday night I got quite a scare,
I woke up and Dog just wasn't there.
I called out and reached out for Dog's hand,
In the darkness where Dog usually stands.
Then I poked through the house, in each cranny and nook,
But I found somebody each place that I looked.
I searched till I'm tired, and now with the dawn,
There's no doubt about it-
Dog's gone!
