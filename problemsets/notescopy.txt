  # Quality: Sanger / Illumina 1.9  (quality is based on the machine it was run on)

  # I had warnings for per base sequence  The base is a little wonky for the first few base pairs, this is normal.
  # and Per sequence GC.  This is a bacteria and has higher GC content than normal.
  # no over represented sequences.
