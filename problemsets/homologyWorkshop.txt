# honey bee glutathione transferase homology from pri annotated 
# if domain is there, it is there, if it is not there it might just not be in the database.
a)
# How long is the sequence?
# 217 AA

# number in this database 13144
# scoring matix Blosum50 or BL50

# gap penalities (from output)
'''Parameters: BL50 matrix (15:-5)xS, open/ext: -10/-2
 ktup: 2, E-join: 1 (0.448), E-opt: 0.2 (0.118), width:  16
 Scan time:  0.230'''
 one residue = -12 (-10+-2), two residue gap =-14 
small numbers mean small changes, large numbers mean big change
gap open penality everyone does it the same way, open gap is not a gap == problem for biologists

What are each of the numbers after the sequence?
len: length of gene
opt: raw score
bits: normalized score
E(): expected

# no 100% aphis is not in this database
# different starding place is not the best, not the best score

Gaps best vs second best
no gaps in best one gap in best at 198
a lot more gaps in second best
more gaps mean more divergent farther back in time
gap penality puts the gaps closer together
protein world 50% id is really good.
30% is pretty far, so lots of gaps

b)
highest scoreing non homolog
GB_SUHVF Envelope glycoprotein B; Short=gB; G
highest score E value is close to 1
this database is small, very likely there are other proteins with E value greater than 5
do a search with the closest non-homolog, and compare results.
EF1D2 when you search elongation factor the database it does not contain more gultiothion trans genes,
and they may have a glut thoin trans c term, pfam is using a model,
blast may find something that is not in pfam.

there is always one unrelated score.
always one homolog that is really close but only statistically significant..  
Worry if the score is 10, or if the highest is 0.001

c)
not there is our case
the box is part of the best local alighment
half of green nterminal is present, half of the blue c terminal
change it to blosum 52 they go away
the full domain is in the other alignments, therefore it is likely to contain the full domains.
why are they not aligning diverged: that part has diverged even more
blossum 62 finds things that are more closely related 
regions with <20% are hard to match for blossum 50 and impossible for bl 62

you may not see everything that is there because they are too different.
a little too different, too divergent to show up as a match
negative results are just we don't know

2) honey bee vs blast
very similar to what we just did

3) cortactin domains isn human rat and chicken
pfam finds and doesn't find domains.  repeated domains.  gained or lost domains due to exon shuffling
things can be homologus by not align
things can align but not be homologus
